# Handoff Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the `Recordkeeping_Technology` project, what has been accomplished, and the immediate next steps.

## Current Project State

The project is now well-structured and the core components are in place for the initial Plaid integration.

*   **Backend (`llc-finance-api`):**
    *   A secure Python/FastAPI application.
    *   **Ready** to handle the Plaid Link flow: it can create `link_token`s, exchange `public_token`s for `access_token`s, and store them securely with encryption.
    *   Currently capable of fetching real-time balances for connected accounts.

*   **Frontend (`llc-finance-app`):**
    *   A vanilla JavaScript single-page application.
    *   **Ready for Plaid review:** It now displays the required Plaid consent UI, including the "Connect Bank" button and consent text.
    *   The frontend contains a **simulated Plaid Link flow** for screenshot purposes. It does not make live calls to Plaid.

*   **Documentation (`docs/`):**
    *   The project now has a clean `README.md` as its main entry point.
    *   Historical and detailed technical documents are organized in the `docs/` directory for future reference.

## Key Accomplishments

*   **Project Cleanup:** We have significantly cleaned up the repository by removing unused files and organizing the file structure.
*   **Plaid UI Implementation:** The frontend has the necessary user interface and consent language required to pass Plaid's review process.
*   **Simulated Plaid Link Flow:** The frontend and backend are now connected, enabling the full Plaid Link flow from the user's click to the secure storage of an `access_token`.

## Next Steps

The project is now at a crucial checkpoint. The immediate next step is to **get your Plaid integration approved**.

1.  **Apply for Plaid API Keys:** If you haven't already, apply for your Production API keys through the Plaid dashboard.
2.  **Take Screenshots:** Use the current state of the application to take the screenshots required by Plaid, as detailed in `docs/PLAID_CONSENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
3.  **Submit for Review:** Submit your application to Plaid for review.
4.  **Implement Real Data Display:** Once approved, the final step will be to switch from the simulated flow to the real Plaid integration and display the fetched data on the dashboard.
