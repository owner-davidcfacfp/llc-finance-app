Got it. I created the handoff docs and removed all cron references, and I added       
the Plaid Link UI in the header. Below are precise steps to “save it to GitHub”       
for both repos.                                                                       
                                                                                      
**Files Created**                                                                     
- Backend: `llc-finance-api/HANDOFF.md` (updated with Plaid setup; no cron)           
- Frontend: `llc-finance-app/HANDOFF.md` (reflects “Link Bank” button; no cron)       
                                                                                      
**Frontend (llc-finance-app)**                                                        
- What changed:                                                                       
  - `index.html`: adds Plaid script and a “Link Bank” button.                         
  - `js/app.js`: adds Plaid Link flow (requests `/plaid/link-token`, opens Link,      
 then `/plaid/exchange`), keeps Refresh Balances flow.                                
  - `HANDOFF.md`: usage, PR steps, and Plaid setup quick guide.                       
                                                                                      
- Save to GitHub (from your local clone on C:):                                       
  - `git checkout -b handoff-doc-and-plaid-link`                                      
  - `git add index.html js/app.js HANDOFF.md`                                         
  - `git commit -m "docs: add HANDOFF + feat: Plaid Link UI and Refresh Balances      
 wiring"`                                                                             
  - `git push origin handoff-doc-and-plaid-link`                                      
  - `gh pr create --title "Handoff doc + Plaid Link UI" --body "Adds HANDOFF.md       
and Plaid Link UI; updates state persistence and refresh balances."`                  
                                                                                      
If your local repo does not yet have these changes, I can generate a single patc      
h you can `git apply`. Just say “send patch.”                                         
**Backend (llc-finance-api)**
- What’s ready:
  - `HANDOFF.md`: full instructions, Render CLI deploy steps, Plaid setup (“Help      
 David set up his Plaid credentials”).
  - Code already present in `llc-finance-api/` (FastAPI, Dockerfile, render.yaml      
, etc.)Re

- Save to GitHub (create a new repo and push):
  - `cd llc-finance-api`
  - `git init && git add . && git commit -m "init: minimal FastAPI backend + HAN      
DOFF"`
  - Create remote repo (choose private/public):
    - `gh repo create owner-davidcfacfp/llc-finance-api --private --source . --p      
ush`
  - Or manually add remote:
    - `git remote add origin https://github.com/owner-davidcfacfp/llc-finance-ap      
i.git`
    - `git push -u origin main`

After pushing the backend repo, deploy via Render CLI following `llc-finance-api      
/HANDOFF.md`:
- `render blueprint deploy`
- Set secrets: `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, `FERNET_KEY`; and `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `      
PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV` if using Plaid.
- Point the UI once with `?apiBase=...&apiKey=...`, use “Link Bank” to connect (      
Sandbox first), then “↻ Refresh Balances”.

If you prefer, add me as a collaborator to the frontend repo and I’ll push the b      
ranch and open the PR for you.
